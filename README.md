Various analyses in R
Repository created on April 28,2025. Involves code written by Elif Poyraz.

1) TOM-I Analysis: This is for analyzing a part of my PhD dissertation data. Contains cross-sectional data of 249 children, tested on various Theory of Mind and Inhibition tasks. Currently the manuscript is in prep, and data cannot be shared. Anonymous data will be made available once the manuscript is under review.
2) Lulu-EpistemicAction: This is a script I wrote to clear out the response data sheets downloaded from Lookit per subject. Each .csv file for a subject contains various trial information unnecessary for analysis. This code runs through multiple .csv files, saves the sheets into dataframes, clears out dataframes, saves the information out into a .csv file along with condition means. The study is still actively collecting data.
